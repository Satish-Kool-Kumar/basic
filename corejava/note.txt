Local	Variable	Type	Inference	 in	a	 for	Loop:
JDK	10	introduced	a	feature	called	local 	variable
type	inference,	which	allows	the	type	of	a	local 	variable	to	be	inferred	from	the
type	of	its	initializer.	To	use	local 	variable	type	inference,	the	type	of	the
variable	is	specified	as	var	and	the	variable	must 	be	initialized.	Local 	variable
type	inference	can	be	used	in	a	for	loop	when	declaring	and	initializing	the
loop	control 	variable	inside	a	traditional 	for	loop,	or	when	specifying	the
iteration	variable	in	a	for-each	for.
